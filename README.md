## Encoding Conversion ##

Not yet another zawgyi<>unicode converter! Using a set of normalized regular expression rules – adapted from Solveware's [parabeik](https://github.com/ngwestar/parabaik) converter –  zawgyi<>unicode conversion routines will be generated for a variety of programming languages.

Currently, the following languages are supported – `python`, `javascript`, `go`. See the sub-direcotory's [README](converter/README.md) for more details.
